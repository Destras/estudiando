        ASCII Capitals
        Each character in the English Alphabet has an ASCII Char Code.

        Given a sentence, return the sentence with one change:

        For a word, if the sum of its letter's char codes is above the global average sum of char codes (i.e if the sum
        of char codes for a word is 205) and on average, a word in the sentence has a char code sum of 189, capitalise
        the word.

        For example:

        Word Tell me the time
        Sum 401 210 321 431
        Since on average, a word in this sentence has a char code sum of 340.75, "Tell" & "time" would be returned
        capitalised: "TELL me the TIME"

        Examples
        averageASCII("Tell me the time") ➞ "TELL me the TIME"
        // Global Average for char code sum of a word is 340.75

        averageASCII("To be or not to be") ➞ "To be or NOT to be"
        // Global Average for char code sum of a word is 230.33

        averageASCII("Edabit helps you learn in bitesize chunks") ➞ "EDABIT HELPS you learn in BITESIZE CHUNKS"
        // Global Average for char code sum of a word is 533.43
        Notes
        Do not count whitespace as part of a word.
        There will be no punctuation/special characters in the tests.
        If a word does not meet the capitalisation citeria, don't fully lowercase it ⁠— leave it how it is (i.e. the
        first words of a sentence should not be fully lowercased if they don't meet the criteria).
        The char code of a capital letter will be different than its lowercase counterpart.
        When you find the global average, it may help to round it to 2 decimal places, then compare against it.
